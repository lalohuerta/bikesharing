## Summary 

In conclusion bike sharing bussinesses have a very high acceptance from the public in metropolitan areas mainly because of the traffic jams, lack of parcking spaces, this means Citi Bike services are used as an alternative to driving and public transport, specifically people use this kind of transportation to reach to their offices or place to work.

If you want to get deeper in this analysis there are some many things you can analize such as:

* Age of users in order to get some kind of programs.
* Analize traffic information.
* Compare data to analize trends all year.
* Analize pick & drop points to get more stations according demand.
